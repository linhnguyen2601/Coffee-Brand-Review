## Key findings:
1. Coffee beans of 60% of brand Names are originated from Ethiopa, Columbia and Kenya. However, these beans are mainly produced in the US (56.6%), Taiwan(31.53%) and Hawai'i (5.42%). Even though, on average, roasting companies in these three countries are not rated as high as Australia, England and Kenya whose's number of roasters included in this dataset is not greater than 2.
2. Kakalove Cafe is the roaster that has the largest number of brand names under its umbrella with 91 brand names, followed by JBC Coffee Roasters with 80 and Paradise Roasters with 77. Kakalove Coffee is a Taiwanese roasters while JBC Coffee Roasters and Paradise Roasters are from the US.
3. Similar to the scenerio of countries of roasters, roasters which own the highest number of brand names are not rated as high as those who have a small number of brand name. Most of top 20 roasters who have highest raking on average are those who only have one brand name.
4. By rating, the most highly rated brand names are given the score of 97. There are 9 of them. 83% of brand names are rated between 92 and 95.
5. By type of roast, nearly three quarters of brand names are categorized as medium-light, while the next most popular category, light, is much lower at 16%. Nevertheless, the average rating among these categories is minor.
6. There are brand names that have more than one roaster produce their coffee beans. Considerably, Ethiopia Kayon Mountain has as many as 5 coffee roasting companies.
7. As expected, there is a small positive correlation between rating and price.
