## üç´ Introduction and Data Background
The dataset covers 1,245 reviews of 1,141 coffee brands from 294 roaster locations during the period from November 2017 to November 2022. 

The report shows where the coffee beans of each brand come from, the roasters that serve each brand, and the countries where the roasters operate. It also highlights which coffee brands received the best ratings and which ones are the most expensive. Additionally, the dataset provides short descriptions and information about the aromas and flavors (mouthfeel) of each coffee brand.

## üç´ Objectives 
There are two main objectives for this project:

Objective 1: Effectively clean and transform the dataset to enable proper data analysis

Objective 2: Unveil interesting and useful insights from the data, answering business questions and providing strategic recommendations

## üç´ Business Questions:
Q1: Which brand names are rated highest?

Q2: What is the range of ratings these brand names are assessed on? Is there a relationship between ratings and prices?

Q3: What are the countries of origin and countries of production for these brand names? Are there any regional trends in ratings, such as whether certain regions consistently produce higher-rated coffees?

Q4: Which roaster has the highest average rating across all its brand names?

Q5: What are the most common aroma and flavor profiles described in the dataset?

Q6: What is the average price of the top-rated coffee brands compared to the average price of all coffee brands in the dataset?

Q7: Which roasters have the most diverse range of coffee origins under their brand names?

Q8: How do the ratings of medium-light roasts compare to those of light roasts?

Q9: How do the prices of coffee brands from different countries of origin compare?

## üç´ Key Findings:
1. The most highly rated brand names receive a score of 97, with nine brands achieving this rating. Additionally, 83% of brand names are rated between 92 and 95.

2. As expected, there is a small positive correlation between rating and price. The higher the rating a brand receives, the more likely it is to be pricey.

3. Coffee beans of 60% of brand names originate from Ethiopia, Colombia, and Kenya. However, these beans are primarily roasted in the US (56.6%), Taiwan (31.53%), and Hawai'i (5.42%). Despite this, on average, roasting companies in these three countries are not rated as highly as those in Australia, England, and Kenya, which have fewer than two roasters included in this dataset.

4. Kakalove Cafe is the roaster with the largest number of brand names under its umbrella, with 91 brands, followed by JBC Coffee Roasters with 80 and Paradise Roasters with 77. Kakalove Cafe is a Taiwanese roaster, while JBC Coffee Roasters and Paradise Roasters are based in the US.

Similar to the scenario with the countries of roasters, roasters owning the highest number of brand names are not rated as highly as those with a smaller number of brand names. Most of the top 20 highest-rated roasters, on average, have only one brand name.

5. The most common aroma and flavor profiles described in the dataset is chocolate, nib, cocoa.

6. The avergae price of top-rated 

9. By type of roast, nearly three-quarters of brand names are categorized as medium-light, while the next most popular category, light, is much lower at 16%. However, the difference in average ratings among these categories is minor.

10. Some brand names have more than one roaster producing their coffee beans. Notably, Ethiopia Kayon Mountain has as many as five different coffee roasting companies.
